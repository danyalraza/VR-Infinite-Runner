#Multiplayer VR Infinite Runner

Infinite runner games are quite common in today's app marketplace, but they are also incredibly popular among casual mobile users. To bring VR into the mainstream, we decided to incorporate VR into one of the most common types of mobile apps there are. To take things to the next level, we added multiplayer to the mix; something that most infinite runners don't incorporate at all. The result is the framework for an intense, fast-paced, competitive game that can be played solo or against friends.
